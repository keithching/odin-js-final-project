## PROJECT: JS Final Project - The Gram
my take on building an Instagram clone app.


## Techniques involved
1. React as Frontend framework (with create react app)
2. React Router for client-side routing
3. Firebase as Backend
- Authentication
    - Google sign-in
- Cloud Firestore
    1. some extra user data
        - info
            - username used in the app
            - user full name displayed in the app
            - user avatar
        - posts
            - publishd posts
            - saved posts
    2. posts data
        - post caption 
        - comments
        - likes
- Cloud Storage
    1. storing user's profile pics
    2. storing post's photos


## Libraries used
